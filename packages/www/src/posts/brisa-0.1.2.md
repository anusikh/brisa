## Add `idleTimeout` for Bun & Node.js runtimes

In this version, we have added the `idleTimeout` property to the `brisa.config.ts` file. This property allows you to set the maximum amount of time a connection is allowed to be idle before the server closes it. A connection is idling if there is no data sent or received.

**brisa.config.ts**:

```ts 4
import type { Configuration } from "brisa";

export default {
  idleTimeout: 10,
} satisfies Configuration;
```

[Learn more about the `idleTimeout` property](/building-your-application/configuring/idle-timeout).

## Stream SQLite queries

Async generators can now be used in conjunction with SQLite queries to stream HTML content. This is useful when you want to render a large amount of data without blocking the main thread and the user can start seeing the content as it is being fetched.

```tsx
import { Database } from "bun:sqlite";

const db = new Database("db.sqlite");

export default function MovieList() {
  return (
    <ul>
      <MovieItems />
    </ul>
  );
}

// Streaming HTML from SQLite query
async function* MovieItems() {
  for (const movie of db.query("SELECT title, year FROM movies")) {
    yield (
      <li>
        {movie.title} ({movie.year})
      </li>
    );
  }
}
```

## `i18n` fixes and improvements

In this version, it is possible to use formatters through `format` inside Web Components. This property captures the interpolations to format them as you like, for example:

```json
{
  "hello": "Hola, {{name}}",
  "helloWithFormat": "Hola, {{name, uppercase}}"
}
```

To consume it:

```ts
t("hello", { name: "Brisa" }); // Hola, Brisa
t("helloWithFormat", { name: "Brisa" }); // Hola, BRISA
```

In this case, the `helloWithFormat` key will be formatted to `uppercase`. To define all the formatters, you can check the [i18n documentation](/building-your-application/internationalization#formatters).

## Complex extensions in `fileSystemRouter`

In this version, we have added support to composed extensions in `fileSystemRouter`, e.g.: `.d.ts`.

## Fix bug SPA Navigation with server actions

In this version, we have fixed a bug that occurred when the same element was in different routes but in each route had a different server action.

## Fix some bugs in Windows

There are still some bugs in Windows that will be fixed for the next release, but for the time being this version fixes some bugs such as the detection of Web Components.

## Skip `undefined` attributes

Previously it could happen that an element had an `"undefined"`, e.g.: `<div class="undefined">`, now it has been fixed so that the attribute is not added if the value is `undefined`.

## Add issue templates on GitHub

In this version, we have added issue templates to help you create better issues.
